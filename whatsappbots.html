    <h2>What Are WhatsApp Bots?</h2>
    <p>
        WhatsApp bots are automated systems that perform tasks inside WhatsApp without needing you
        to type every response manually. They can reply to messages, manage groups, provide customer
        support, run menus, handle orders, save contacts, answer FAQs and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Businesses, students, shop owners, freelancers and creators use bots to save time and increase productivity.
        A bot can work 24/7, never gets tired and answers instantly — even when you are asleep 😄.
    </p>

    <p>
        At MZAZI TECH INC., we focus on **ethical, helpful and productive automation** that adds value to people and businesses.

    <h2>Types of WhatsApp Bots</h2>
    <p>Generally, bots are grouped into two main categories:</p>
</section>


<section>
    <h2>1. Normal WhatsApp Bots</h2>

    <p>
        These are the standard, productive bots designed to assist with **normal daily tasks**. They are the most
        recommended and widely used because they help rather than harm.
    </p>

    <p>
        Normal bots can:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>✔ Auto-reply to messages</li>
        <li>✔ Manage WhatsApp groups</li>
        <li>✔ Provide customer service</li>
        <li>✔ Run business menus and catalogs</li>
        <li>✔ Save contacts and export data</li>
        <li>✔ Answer frequently asked questions</li>
        <li>✔ Help content creators automate tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These bots can be **free or paid**, depending on features, hosting, performance and the amount of automation
        you need. Advanced business-grade bots usually require subscriptions or setup fees because they run on servers.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are legal, ethical and perfect for business growth and personal productivity.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>2. “Bug” or Attack-Style Bots</h2>

    <p>
        These are bots designed to flood chats with spam, crashes, or heavy message payloads with the intention of
        disrupting devices, annoying people, or damaging accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are often talked about online as “bug bots.” While they exist, they are **harmful, abusive and can violate
        platform rules and local laws**. They can lead to account bans or legal consequences, and they harm real people.
    </p>

    <p>
        For that reason, **MZAZI TECH INC. does not develop, sell, promote or support harmful or attack-style bots**.
        Our focus is responsible technology that helps users, not hurts them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Any discussion of such bots is only educational — understanding risks, safety, reporting and protection.
        The best use of technology is building, not destroying.
    </p>

        <li>✔ maintenance and support</li>
